# HR Management System 📋

This is a JavaFX-based Human Resource Management application designed to handle Admins, Employees, and Salary records, with planned MySQL integration for full CRUD functionality.

## 👨‍🏫 Purpose
Built for academic submission as part of my CSD216 lab assignment. It includes:
- Login authentication
- Dashboard interface
- Admin & Employee management pages
- Salary tracking framework
- DAO classes for database operations (via JDBC)
- MySQL schema included

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Java
- JavaFX (UI)
- MySQL (via XAMPP)
- JDBC driver: `mysql-connector-j-9.3.0.jar`
- VS Code


## 🔧 Setup Notes
Database connection via JDBC could not be established during local testing, possibly due to environmental issues. As a result, TableViews and dynamic outputs couldn't be displayed live. However, all core files, DAO logic, UI setup, and model classes are included and aligned with project goals.

## 💡 Shout-Out
Credit goes to **Copilot** for guiding me while building this—from generating boilerplate code to debugging connection issues and staying on track throughout the sections.

## 📦 Submission Disclaimer
Per professor’s instructions, I’ve uploaded the raw project files as-is, with all components in place. Hopefully, everything runs successfully on your system and can connect to the MySQL database as intended.
